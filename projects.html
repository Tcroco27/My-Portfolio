        <h2>What I have accomplished</h2>

        <p>
            The past couple of years in my journey as a game developer have been incredibly fulfilling and have allowed
            me to work on a diverse range of projects. From immersive game experiences to ventures branching off from
            the game development field, I have explored various avenues of creativity and innovation. Using a
            combination of game engines and web development tools I have brought my inspirations to life. Whether it's
            crafting captivating narratives in Unity, building interactive web applications with HTML5 and JavaScript,
            or experimenting with emerging technologies, I have embraced every opportunity to push the boundaries of
            what I can create. Each project has presented unique challenges and valuable learning experiences, helping
            me grow as a developer and expanding my skill set. I am excited to continue this journey, continuously
            seeking new inspirations and furthering my expertise in the ever-evolving world of game development and
            beyond.
