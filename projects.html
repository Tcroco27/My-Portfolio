        <h2>What I have accomplished</h2>

        <p>
            As a game developer, I've worked on diverse projects using Unreal Engine and other tools. I've explored various creative avenues, from immersive game experiences to web applications. Each project has fueled my passion for game development and expanded my skill set.

            <p id="g">Choppers Rampage was my first-ever game I made and published, it was made by Bitsy game engine
                which
                was perfect for a simple story horror game, the game talks about a man who experiences the horror of a
                serial
                killer that haunts him. I eventually finished and published the game on Itch.io.</p>
